## Embarrassment-Based Procrastination Deterrent

**Created during PennApps Fall 2013**

This Chrome Extension allows users to block websites they frequent during certain times in order for them to more easily focus on work that needs to be done. The problem with other such solutions is that when time runs out, the user is either not allowed to get more time or they are required to perform a meticulous, boring, lengthy task. The easiest solution with one of these blockades is to just uninstall the extension. With this extension, adding more time is just a simple as clicking a button. However, in order to get more time, the extension inflicts certain "penalties" on the user. While allowing for quick access back to the user's websites, yet still imposing a punishment, the extension remains installed long enough on the user's machine in order to deter them from wasting time on the internet.

## Client-Side Interface

This Extension is built primarily around a form through which users can submit the websites they would like to track and block based off of their usage. This form communicates with our backend using Chrome's localStorage API. After users block sites they cannot edit any of the information involving that site, whether that be the URL or time alottment.
